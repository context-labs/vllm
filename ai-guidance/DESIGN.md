# Goal

Our goal is to add hidden states support to the v1 engine in vLLM.

# Background

Hidden states are the activations of the model just prior to the LM head.
There is a unique hidden states vector for each token in the sequence, 
arranged in a 2D tensor of shape [num_tokens, hidden_size].

As a first goal, we would like to be able to return hidden states for each sequence group.

Then, as a secondary goal, we would like to return these hidden states through the OpenAI API for:
    - /v1/chat/completions (Streaming and non-streaming)
    - /v1/completions (streaming and non-streaming)
But when returned through the OpenAI API, only the hidden states for the last token in each sequence group should be returned.

# Scope

We want to implement this feature only for the v1 engine in vLLM, and not for the v0 implementation.

# Challenges

The design of the v1 engine has a clean separation between the core engine and other system components.  In v1, to communicate between the core engine and other components of the system, state is sent over the wire via zmq.

As such, it is probably not practical to send the full hidden states over the wire via zmq for every token, but only for the last token.  That's because of both the memory cost and the serialization cost (let's suppose that a sequence has 500 total tokens across prefill and response - then the hidden states with dimension 4096 and bfloat16 would have about 31mb of data, which would potentially need to be moved from GPU to CPU (if not already) and then converted to a list[list[float]]!)

What's more, it's not entirely clear to me if the engine component of the system has any way to determine if the decoded token is the last token in a sequence.

Thus, we may have to send a message to indicate that the last token has been decoded, and then return the hidden states for that token from the core engine.  However, there may be a superior design.

# Architectural Analysis

## Hidden States Extraction Point

Based on analysis of the vLLM v1 codebase, hidden states should be extracted in the model's forward pass immediately after the final normalization layer and before the LM head projection:

```python
# In LlamaModel.forward() (~line 399 in vllm/model_executor/models/llama.py)
hidden_states, _ = self.norm(hidden_states, residual)
# ^ This is the optimal extraction point for hidden states
return hidden_states  # These are the pre-LM head activations
```

## Advanced Features Integration

### Speculative Execution Integration

vLLM v1's speculative execution generates multiple candidate tokens that are later verified. Hidden states implementation must handle:

1. **Multiple Token Generation**: Each request can generate `num_generated_tokens` varying per request
2. **Speculative Verification**: Only verified tokens should have their hidden states returned
3. **Rollback Scenarios**: When speculative tokens are rejected, corresponding hidden states should be discarded

```python
# In ModelRunnerOutput:
# sampled_token_ids: list[list[int]]  # num_reqs x variable_generated_tokens
# spec_token_ids: Optional[list[list[int]]]  # num_reqs x variable_spec_tokens

# Hidden states must align with accepted tokens only
def filter_hidden_states_by_acceptance(
    hidden_states: torch.Tensor,  # [total_tokens, hidden_size]
    acceptance_mask: torch.Tensor,  # [total_tokens]
    req_indices: torch.Tensor  # [total_tokens]
) -> dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    # Return only hidden states for accepted tokens
    pass
```

### CUDA Graph Optimization Strategy

vLLM v1 heavily relies on CUDA graphs for performance. Hidden states extraction must be graph-compatible:

```python
class HiddenStatesExtractor:
    def __init__(self, max_batch_size: int, hidden_size: int):
        # Pre-allocate maximum size buffers
        self.hidden_states_buffer = torch.zeros(
            (max_batch_size, hidden_size),
            dtype=torch.float16,
            device="cuda"
        )
        self.extraction_mask = torch.zeros(
            max_batch_size,
            dtype=torch.bool,
            device="cuda"
        )
    
    def extract_cuda_graph_safe(
        self,
        model_hidden_states: torch.Tensor,
        batch_size: int,
        request_needs_hidden_states: torch.Tensor
    ) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Use masked operations instead of conditional logic
        # Ensure fixed tensor shapes for graph capture
        pass
```

## Solution: Post-Sampling Prefill Strategy via ZMQ

**Concept:** After identifying finished sequences, send separate `HiddenStatesExtractionRequest` messages via ZMQ to trigger prefill-based hidden states extraction. This maintains the v1 engine's clean separation of concerns.

### Implementation Design

#### 1. Request Flow Architecture

```
[OutputProcessor] → [ZMQ] → [EngineCore] → [Scheduler] → [GPUModelRunner] → [Model.forward()]
      ↓                        ↓                                                      ↓
CompletedRequestInfo → HiddenStatesExtractionRequest → EngineCoreRequest → hidden_states
```

#### 2. Core Components

**HiddenStatesExtractionRequest** (New ZMQ message type):
```python
class HiddenStatesExtractionRequest:
    request_id: str
    original_request_id: str  
    sequence_tokens: list[int]  # Full sequence: prompt + generated tokens
    target_position: int  # Position to extract (-1 for last token)
    arrival_time: float
```

**Request Processing Flow**:
```python
# In OutputProcessor.process_outputs()
def process_outputs(self, engine_core_outputs):
    completed_requests = []
    
    for output in engine_core_outputs:
        if output.finished and needs_hidden_states(output.request_id):
            completed_requests.append(CompletedRequestInfo(
                request_id=output.request_id,
                original_request=self.get_original_request(output.request_id),
                sequence_tokens=self.get_full_sequence(output.request_id),
                final_token_position=self.get_final_position(output.request_id)
            ))
    
    return OutputProcessorOutput(
        request_outputs=request_outputs,
        reqs_to_abort=reqs_to_abort,
        completed_requests=completed_requests  # NEW: For hidden states processing
    )

# In Engine/API layer - trigger hidden states extraction
def handle_completed_requests(self, completed_requests):
    for completed_req in completed_requests:
        if completed_req.original_request.return_hidden_states:
            hs_request = HiddenStatesExtractionRequest(
                request_id=f"hs_{completed_req.request_id}",
                original_request_id=completed_req.request_id,
                sequence_tokens=completed_req.sequence_tokens,
                target_position=completed_req.final_token_position,
                arrival_time=time.time()
            )
            # Send via ZMQ to EngineCore
            self.send_zmq_request(EngineCoreRequestType.HIDDEN_STATES_EXTRACT, hs_request)
```

**EngineCore Hidden States Handler**:
```python
# In EngineCore._handle_hidden_states_request()
def _handle_hidden_states_request(self, hs_request: HiddenStatesExtractionRequest):
    """Convert hidden states request to prefill-only EngineCoreRequest."""
    
    prefill_request = EngineCoreRequest(
        request_id=hs_request.request_id,
        prompt_token_ids=hs_request.sequence_tokens,
        mm_inputs=None,
        mm_hashes=None,
        mm_placeholders=None,
        sampling_params=SamplingParams(max_tokens=0),  # Prefill only
        eos_token_id=None,
        arrival_time=hs_request.arrival_time,
        lora_request=None,
        cache_salt=None,
        return_hidden_states=True,  # Key: Enable hidden states extraction
        hidden_states_for_tokens=[hs_request.target_position]
    )
    
    # Add to scheduler for immediate processing
    self.scheduler.add_request(prefill_request)
```

**Model Runner Integration**:
```python
# In GPUModelRunner.execute_model()
def execute_model(self, scheduler_output):
    # Standard execution (unchanged for main generation loop)
    model_output = self.model(...)
    sampler_output = self.sampler(logits, sampling_metadata)
    
    # Handle hidden states extraction requests
    hidden_states_dict = {}
    for req_id in scheduler_output.req_ids:
        request = scheduler_output.requests[req_id]
        if request.return_hidden_states:
            # Extract hidden states during forward pass
            hidden_states_dict[req_id] = self.extract_hidden_states(
                model_output, request.hidden_states_for_tokens
            )
    
    return ModelRunnerOutput(
        # ... existing fields ...
        last_hidden_states=hidden_states_dict if hidden_states_dict else None
    )
```

### Key Benefits

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Management
```python
# Use memory pools to avoid allocations
class HiddenStatesPool:
    def get_buffer(self, batch_size: int, hidden_size: int) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Reuse pre-allocated buffers
        pass
```

### 2. Selective Computation
Only extract hidden states when explicitly requested to minimize performance impact.

### 3. Efficient Serialization
Convert to CPU and serialize to list[float] only when needed for ZMQ transfer.

### 4. Torch.compile Compatibility
Hidden states extraction should work with the v1 compilation system without breaking graph capture.

### 5. Speculative Execution Considerations
vLLM v1 supports speculative decoding where multiple tokens are generated speculatively and then verified. Hidden states implementation must account for:

```python
# In ModelRunnerOutput, we already have:
# sampled_token_ids: list[list[int]]  # num_reqs x num_generated_tokens
# spec_token_ids: Optional[list[list[int]]]  # num_reqs x num_spec_tokens

# Hidden states must handle multiple tokens per request:
# - Extract hidden states for all generated tokens (including speculative)
# - Only return hidden states for verified/accepted tokens
# - Handle rollback scenarios where speculative tokens are rejected
```

**Key Implementation Points:**
- Hidden states extraction should happen after speculative verification
- Only store hidden states for accepted tokens to avoid memory waste
- Consider batch size variations due to speculative acceptance/rejection

### 6. CUDA Graph Capture Compatibility
vLLM v1 uses CUDA graphs for performance optimization. Hidden states implementation must ensure:

```python
# Hidden states extraction should not break CUDA graph capture
def extract_hidden_states_cuda_graph_safe(
    hidden_states: torch.Tensor,
    request_indices: torch.Tensor,
    extract_mask: torch.Tensor
) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Use only CUDA graph compatible operations
    # Avoid dynamic shapes or conditional execution
    # Pre-allocate buffers with maximum possible size
    pass
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- **Static Memory Allocation**: Pre-allocate hidden states buffers with maximum batch size
- **Avoid Dynamic Branching**: Use masked operations instead of conditional extraction
- **Consistent Tensor Shapes**: Ensure hidden states tensors have fixed shapes across graph captures
- **No Host-Device Synchronization**: Avoid CPU operations during graph execution

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# Pre-allocate buffer for maximum possible batch size
max_batch_size = 512
hidden_states_buffer = torch.zeros(
    (max_batch_size, hidden_size), 
    dtype=torch.float16, 
    device="cuda"
)

# Use masked extraction instead of conditional logic
extraction_mask = create_extraction_mask(batch_size, request_configs)
extracted_states = hidden_states_buffer * extraction_mask.unsqueeze(-1)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run existing tests** to establish baseline and identify specific failure points
2. **Implement Phase 1** core infrastructure changes
3. **Enable tests incrementally** as features are completed
4. **Monitor performance** throughout implementation
5. **Add optimization** based on test feedback

The comprehensive test suite provides clear implementation guidance and will validate functionality as development progresses.
