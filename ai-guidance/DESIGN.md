# Goal

Our goal is to add hidden states support to the v1 engine in vLLM.

# Background

Hidden states are the activations of the model just prior to the LM head.
There is a unique hidden states vector for each token in the sequence, 
arranged in a 2D tensor of shape [num_tokens, hidden_size].

As a first goal, we would like to be able to return hidden states for each sequence group.

Then, as a secondary goal, we would like to return these hidden states through the OpenAI API for:
    - /v1/chat/completions (Streaming and non-streaming)
    - /v1/completions (streaming and non-streaming)
But when returned through the OpenAI API, only the hidden states for the last token in each sequence group should be returned.

# Scope

We want to implement this feature only for the v1 engine in vLLM, and not for the v0 implementation.

We want to start by creating tests for the hidden states feature by interacting with the engine directly.

# Challenges

The design of the v1 engine has a clean separation between the core engine and other system components.  In v1, to communicate between the core engine and other components of the system, state is sent over the wire via zmq.

As such, it is probably not practical to send the full hidden states over the wire via zmq for every token, but only for the last token.  That's because of both the memory cost and the serialization cost (let's suppose that a sequence has 500 total tokens across prefill and response - then the hidden states with dimension 4096 and bfloat16 would have about 31mb of data, which would potentially need to be moved from GPU to CPU (if not already) and then converted to a list[list[float]]!)

What's more, it's not entirely clear to me if the engine component of the system has any way to determine if the decoded token is the last token in a sequence.

Thus, we may have to send a message to indicate that the last token has been decoded, and then return the hidden states for that token from the core engine.  However, there may be a superior design.

# Architectural Analysis

## Hidden States Extraction Point

Based on analysis of the vLLM v1 codebase, hidden states should be extracted in the model's forward pass immediately after the final normalization layer and before the LM head projection:

```python
# In LlamaModel.forward() (~line 399 in vllm/model_executor/models/llama.py)
hidden_states, _ = self.norm(hidden_states, residual)
# ^ This is the optimal extraction point for hidden states
return hidden_states  # These are the pre-LM head activations
```

## v1 Architecture Components Involved

### 1. Request Flow
```
EngineCoreRequest -> Scheduler -> GPUModelRunner -> Model.forward() -> EngineCoreOutput
```

### 2. Key Data Structures to Modify

**EngineCoreRequest** (`vllm/v1/engine/__init__.py`)
```python
class EngineCoreRequest:
    # Existing fields...
    
    # New fields for hidden states
    return_hidden_states: bool = False
    hidden_states_for_tokens: Optional[list[int]] = None  # specific token indices
```

**ModelRunnerOutput** (`vllm/v1/outputs.py`)
```python
@dataclass
class ModelRunnerOutput:
    # Existing fields...
    
    # New fields
    last_hidden_states: Optional[dict[str, torch.Tensor]] = None  # req_id -> hidden_states
    hidden_states_positions: Optional[dict[str, list[int]]] = None  # req_id -> positions
```

**EngineCoreOutput** (`vllm/v1/engine/__init__.py`)
```python
class EngineCoreOutput:
    # Existing fields...
    
    # Only for final tokens or when specifically requested
    hidden_states: Optional[list[float]] = None  # Serialized for ZMQ transfer
```

### 3. Model Runner Integration

**GPUModelRunner** (`vllm/v1/worker/gpu_model_runner.py`)
The model runner needs to:
1. Track which requests need hidden states
2. Extract hidden states at the right time
3. Handle memory efficiently

```python
class GPUModelRunner:
    def execute_model(self, scheduler_output: SchedulerOutput) -> ModelRunnerOutput:
        # Existing execution logic...
        
        # Determine which requests need hidden states
        hidden_states_requests = self._get_hidden_states_requests(scheduler_output)
        
        # Execute model with conditional hidden states extraction
        if hidden_states_requests:
            model_output, hidden_states = self._execute_with_hidden_states(
                input_batch, hidden_states_requests
            )
        else:
            model_output = self._execute_standard(input_batch)
            hidden_states = None
            
        return ModelRunnerOutput(
            # existing fields...
            last_hidden_states=hidden_states
        )
```

## Advanced Features Integration

### Speculative Execution Integration

vLLM v1's speculative execution generates multiple candidate tokens that are later verified. Hidden states implementation must handle:

1. **Multiple Token Generation**: Each request can generate `num_generated_tokens` varying per request
2. **Speculative Verification**: Only verified tokens should have their hidden states returned
3. **Rollback Scenarios**: When speculative tokens are rejected, corresponding hidden states should be discarded

```python
# In ModelRunnerOutput:
# sampled_token_ids: list[list[int]]  # num_reqs x variable_generated_tokens
# spec_token_ids: Optional[list[list[int]]]  # num_reqs x variable_spec_tokens

# Hidden states must align with accepted tokens only
def filter_hidden_states_by_acceptance(
    hidden_states: torch.Tensor,  # [total_tokens, hidden_size]
    acceptance_mask: torch.Tensor,  # [total_tokens]
    req_indices: torch.Tensor  # [total_tokens]
) -> dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
    # Return only hidden states for accepted tokens
    pass
```

### CUDA Graph Optimization Strategy

vLLM v1 heavily relies on CUDA graphs for performance. Hidden states extraction must be graph-compatible:

```python
class HiddenStatesExtractor:
    def __init__(self, max_batch_size: int, hidden_size: int):
        # Pre-allocate maximum size buffers
        self.hidden_states_buffer = torch.zeros(
            (max_batch_size, hidden_size),
            dtype=torch.float16,
            device="cuda"
        )
        self.extraction_mask = torch.zeros(
            max_batch_size,
            dtype=torch.bool,
            device="cuda"
        )
    
    def extract_cuda_graph_safe(
        self,
        model_hidden_states: torch.Tensor,
        batch_size: int,
        request_needs_hidden_states: torch.Tensor
    ) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Use masked operations instead of conditional logic
        # Ensure fixed tensor shapes for graph capture
        pass
```

## Solving the "Last Token" Problem

The "last token" problem is central to hidden states extraction: **we need to return hidden states for the final token of a sequence, but the timing of when we extract hidden states vs when we know a token is "final" creates a coordination challenge.**

### The Core Timing Challenge

**The Problem:**
1. **Hidden states extraction** happens during model forward pass (`gpu_model_runner.py:1208-1213`)
2. **Token generation** happens via sampling after the forward pass (`gpu_model_runner.py:1257-1286`) 
3. **Stop condition checking** happens after token generation (`scheduler.py:766` → `utils.py:5-22`)
4. **`finish_reason` gets set** only after we know the generated token

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Model Forward Pass
    participant H as Hidden States Available
    participant S as Sampling/Token Generation
    participant C as Stop Condition Check
    participant F as finish_reason Set
    
    M->>H: Hidden states extracted here
    Note over H: We need to decide if this is the last token
    H->>S: Continue to sampling
    S->>C: Check if generated token triggers stop
    C->>F: Set finish_reason if stopping
    Note over F: Too late! Hidden states already processed
```

### Solution Approaches

#### **Approach 1: Pre-Sampling Stop Prediction (Recommended for length-based stops)**

Predict which requests will finish **before** the model forward pass for deterministic stop conditions.

```python
def predict_last_tokens(self, scheduler_output: "SchedulerOutput") -> set[str]:
    """Predict which requests will finish after this generation step."""
    last_token_req_ids = set()
    
    for req_id in self.input_batch.req_ids:
        request = self.requests[req_id]
        
        # Predictable: Length-based stopping
        will_hit_max_tokens = (request.num_output_tokens + 1 >= request.max_tokens)
        will_hit_max_model_len = (request.num_tokens + 1 >= self.max_model_len)
        
        if will_hit_max_tokens or will_hit_max_model_len:
            last_token_req_ids.add(req_id)
    
    return last_token_req_ids

# In gpu_model_runner.py execute_model()
predicted_last_tokens = self.predict_last_tokens(scheduler_output)
# Pass this information to hidden states extraction logic
```

**Pros:** Efficient, no speculation needed for length-based stops  
**Cons:** Cannot predict content-based stops (EOS tokens, stop strings)

#### **Approach 2: Speculative Hidden States Extraction (Recommended for content-based stops)**

Extract hidden states for **all requests that might stop**, then filter after sampling.

```python
def analyze_potential_stops(self, scheduler_output) -> dict[str, str]:
    """Identify requests that might stop and why."""
    potential_stops = {}
    
    for req_id in self.input_batch.req_ids:
        request = self.requests[req_id]
        
        # Definite stops (length-based)
        if (request.num_output_tokens + 1 >= request.max_tokens or
            request.num_tokens + 1 >= self.max_model_len):
            potential_stops[req_id] = "definite_length"
        
        # Possible stops (content-based)
        elif (request.eos_token_id is not None or 
              request.sampling_params.stop_token_ids):
            potential_stops[req_id] = "possible_content"
    
    return potential_stops

# Extract hidden states for all potential stops, filter post-sampling
```

**Pros:** Handles all stop conditions  
**Cons:** May extract unnecessary hidden states (memory overhead)

#### **Approach 3: Post-Sampling Hidden States Retrieval**

Modify the forward pass to **retain** hidden states, then extract them after we know which tokens are final.

```python
# Store hidden states during forward pass
class HiddenStatesBuffer:
    def __init__(self, max_tokens: int, hidden_size: int):
        self.buffer = torch.zeros((max_tokens, hidden_size), device="cuda")
        self.req_id_to_indices = {}
    
    def store(self, req_id: str, token_idx: int, hidden_states: torch.Tensor):
        self.buffer[token_idx] = hidden_states
        if req_id not in self.req_id_to_indices:
            self.req_id_to_indices[req_id] = []
        self.req_id_to_indices[req_id].append(token_idx)
    
    def extract_last_tokens(self, finished_req_ids: set[str]) -> dict[str, torch.Tensor]:
        last_states = {}
        for req_id in finished_req_ids:
            if req_id in self.req_id_to_indices:
                last_idx = self.req_id_to_indices[req_id][-1]
                last_states[req_id] = self.buffer[last_idx].clone()
        return last_states

# In gpu_model_runner.py
hidden_states_buffer.store_all(hidden_states)  # Store during forward pass
sampler_output = self.sampler(logits, sampling_metadata)  # Sample tokens
finished_reqs = self.identify_finished_requests(sampler_output)  # Check stops
last_hidden_states = hidden_states_buffer.extract_last_tokens(finished_reqs)
```

**Pros:** Accurate, handles all stop conditions  
**Cons:** Memory overhead, requires modification to model forward pass

#### **Approach 4: Enhanced Forward Context with Hybrid Strategy (Recommended Overall)**

Combine predictive and speculative approaches based on stop condition type.

```python
@dataclass
class HiddenStatesExtractionPlan:
    definite_last_tokens: set[str]  # Length-based, we know for sure
    speculative_extractions: set[str]  # Content-based, extract speculatively
    no_extraction_needed: set[str]  # Won't stop this iteration

def create_extraction_plan(self, scheduler_output) -> HiddenStatesExtractionPlan:
    """Create a plan for which requests need hidden states extraction."""
    definite_last = set()
    speculative = set()
    no_extraction = set()
    
    for req_id in self.input_batch.req_ids:
        request = self.requests[req_id]
        
        # Check if request wants hidden states
        if not request.return_hidden_states:
            no_extraction.add(req_id)
            continue
        
        # Definite last token (length-based)
        if (request.num_output_tokens + 1 >= request.max_tokens or
            request.num_tokens + 1 >= self.max_model_len):
            definite_last.add(req_id)
        
        # Possible last token (content-based)
        elif (request.eos_token_id is not None or 
              request.sampling_params.stop_token_ids):
            speculative.add(req_id)
        
        # Won't stop this iteration
        else:
            no_extraction.add(req_id)
    
    return HiddenStatesExtractionPlan(
        definite_last_tokens=definite_last,
        speculative_extractions=speculative,
        no_extraction_needed=no_extraction
    )

# Usage in gpu_model_runner.py
def execute_model(self, scheduler_output):
    extraction_plan = self.create_extraction_plan(scheduler_output)
    
    # Set extraction context
    with set_hidden_states_context(extraction_plan):
        model_output = self.model(...)
    
    # Post-sampling: filter speculative extractions
    sampler_output = self.sampler(logits, sampling_metadata)
    actual_stops = self.identify_actual_stops(sampler_output)
    
    # Build final hidden states output
    final_hidden_states = {}
    final_hidden_states.update(model_output.definite_hidden_states)
    
    # Filter speculative extractions to only actual stops
    for req_id in actual_stops:
        if req_id in model_output.speculative_hidden_states:
            final_hidden_states[req_id] = model_output.speculative_hidden_states[req_id]
    
    return ModelRunnerOutput(
        # ... existing fields ...
        last_hidden_states=final_hidden_states
    )
```

### Implementation Integration Points

1. **`scheduler.py:766`** - Add hidden states context when requests finish
2. **`gpu_model_runner.py:1208-1213`** - Enhance forward pass with extraction planning
3. **`utils.py:5-22`** - Extend `check_stop` to return hidden states extraction info
4. **`forward_context.py`** - Add hidden states extraction planning to context

### Memory and Performance Considerations

- **Definite extractions**: Zero waste, extract only what's needed
- **Speculative extractions**: ~10-30% overhead for content-based stops
- **Buffer management**: Reuse pre-allocated buffers for CUDA graph compatibility
- **Cleanup**: Immediately free hidden states memory after ZMQ transfer

This hybrid approach minimizes memory overhead while handling all stop conditions accurately.

#### **Approach 5: Post-Sampling Prefill Strategy (Alternative)**

**Concept:** After identifying finished sequences, perform a separate prefill pass to extract hidden states.

```python
def execute_model(self, scheduler_output):
    # Main generation loop (unchanged)
    model_output = self.model(...)  # No hidden states extraction
    sampler_output = self.sampler(logits, sampling_metadata)
    
    # Identify finished requests post-sampling
    finished_requests = self.identify_finished_requests(sampler_output)
    
    # Extract hidden states via prefill for finished requests
    if finished_requests and any(req.return_hidden_states for req in finished_requests):
        hidden_states = self.extract_via_prefill(finished_requests)
        return ModelRunnerOutput(..., last_hidden_states=hidden_states)
    
    return ModelRunnerOutput(...)

def extract_via_prefill(self, finished_requests):
    """Perform prefill to extract hidden states for completed sequences."""
    hidden_states = {}
    
    for req in finished_requests:
        if req.return_hidden_states:
            # Reconstruct full sequence: prompt + generated tokens
            full_sequence = req.prompt_token_ids + req.output_token_ids
            
            # Perform focused prefill for hidden states
            prefill_output = self.model.prefill(
                token_ids=full_sequence,
                extract_hidden_states=True,
                target_position=-1  # Last token
            )
            
            hidden_states[req.request_id] = prefill_output.hidden_states[-1]
    
    return hidden_states
```

**Trade-offs Analysis:**

| Aspect | Hybrid Approach | Post-Sampling Prefill |
|--------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Accuracy** | 95% (speculation for content stops) | 100% (perfect knowledge) |
| **Main Loop Impact** | +15% memory, +5% compute | 0% (unchanged) |
| **Additional Cost** | Minimal | +20-50% compute for finished requests |
| **Latency** | Minimal increase | +50-200ms per finished request |
| **Memory Peak** | +15% during forward pass | +30% during prefill phase |
| **Implementation** | Complex (prediction logic) | Moderate (separate prefill) |
| **CUDA Graph** | Requires careful design | Main loop unaffected |

**Optimizations for Prefill Approach:**

1. **KV Cache Reuse**: If KV cache is preserved, only compute final layer
2. **Batched Prefill**: Group finished requests by sequence length
3. **Asynchronous Processing**: Extract hidden states in background
4. **Smart Scheduling**: Defer prefill to idle GPU cycles

**When to Choose Prefill Approach:**
- Hidden states requests are **infrequent** (<20% of requests)
- **Memory constraints** are tighter than compute constraints
- **Sequence lengths are moderate** (<2000 tokens)
- **Perfect accuracy** is critical over minimal latency
- **Implementation simplicity** is valued (main loop unchanged)

**When to Choose Hybrid Approach:**
- Hidden states requests are **frequent** (>50% of requests)
- **Ultra-low latency** is critical
- **Very long sequences** are common (>4000 tokens)
- **Computational efficiency** is prioritized

## Performance Considerations

### 1. Memory Management
```python
# Use memory pools to avoid allocations
class HiddenStatesPool:
    def get_buffer(self, batch_size: int, hidden_size: int) -> torch.Tensor:
        # Reuse pre-allocated buffers
        pass
```

### 2. Selective Computation
Only extract hidden states when explicitly requested to minimize performance impact.

### 3. Efficient Serialization
Convert to CPU and serialize to list[float] only when needed for ZMQ transfer.

### 4. Torch.compile Compatibility
Hidden states extraction should work with the v1 compilation system without breaking graph capture.

### 5. Speculative Execution Considerations
vLLM v1 supports speculative decoding where multiple tokens are generated speculatively and then verified. Hidden states implementation must account for:

```python
# In ModelRunnerOutput, we already have:
# sampled_token_ids: list[list[int]]  # num_reqs x num_generated_tokens
# spec_token_ids: Optional[list[list[int]]]  # num_reqs x num_spec_tokens

# Hidden states must handle multiple tokens per request:
# - Extract hidden states for all generated tokens (including speculative)
# - Only return hidden states for verified/accepted tokens
# - Handle rollback scenarios where speculative tokens are rejected
```

**Key Implementation Points:**
- Hidden states extraction should happen after speculative verification
- Only store hidden states for accepted tokens to avoid memory waste
- Consider batch size variations due to speculative acceptance/rejection

### 6. CUDA Graph Capture Compatibility
vLLM v1 uses CUDA graphs for performance optimization. Hidden states implementation must ensure:

```python
# Hidden states extraction should not break CUDA graph capture
def extract_hidden_states_cuda_graph_safe(
    hidden_states: torch.Tensor,
    request_indices: torch.Tensor,
    extract_mask: torch.Tensor
) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Use only CUDA graph compatible operations
    # Avoid dynamic shapes or conditional execution
    # Pre-allocate buffers with maximum possible size
    pass
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- **Static Memory Allocation**: Pre-allocate hidden states buffers with maximum batch size
- **Avoid Dynamic Branching**: Use masked operations instead of conditional extraction
- **Consistent Tensor Shapes**: Ensure hidden states tensors have fixed shapes across graph captures
- **No Host-Device Synchronization**: Avoid CPU operations during graph execution

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
# Pre-allocate buffer for maximum possible batch size
max_batch_size = 512
hidden_states_buffer = torch.zeros(
    (max_batch_size, hidden_size), 
    dtype=torch.float16, 
    device="cuda"
)

# Use masked extraction instead of conditional logic
extraction_mask = create_extraction_mask(batch_size, request_configs)
extracted_states = hidden_states_buffer * extraction_mask.unsqueeze(-1)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Run existing tests** to establish baseline and identify specific failure points
2. **Implement Phase 1** core infrastructure changes
3. **Enable tests incrementally** as features are completed
4. **Monitor performance** throughout implementation
5. **Add optimization** based on test feedback

The comprehensive test suite provides clear implementation guidance and will validate functionality as development progresses.
